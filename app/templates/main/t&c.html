<p>Below is our terms of service for our “Platform”, which means any website, application, or service we offer. You should read the complete Terms of Service because that document (and not this overview) is our legally binding agreement.  <em>The Terms of Service includes information about your legal rights and covers areas such as automatic subscription renewals, limitations of liability, resolution of disputes by mandatory arbitration rather than a judge or jury in a court of law, and a class action waiver.</em></p>

</ul>
</div>
<div id="termsOfServiceSection">
<h1 id="terms-of-service">Terms of Service</h1>
<p>Our Terms of Service contain important information about your legal rights. To make it easier to understand, we have provided summaries and tips in these gray boxes. These summaries are not part of the official terms, and it is important for you to read the language in each section carefully.</p>
<div id="agreementsection">
<h4 id="this-agreement">1. This Agreement</h4>
<p>Summary:  You agree to follow some basic rules when using TheTribalBox’s Platform. These rules are described in these Terms of Service, including the related policies and guidelines discussed below. We may change these rules.</p>
<p>1.1 The Agreement.  The terms “TheTribalBox,” “we,” “us,” and “our” include The Tribal Box. We use the terms “you” and “your” to mean any person using our Platform, and any organization or person using the Platform on an organization’s behalf. We use the word “Platform” to mean any website, application, or service offered by TheTribalBox, including content we offer and electronic communications we send. We provide our Platform to you subject to these Terms of Service. Your use of the Platform signifies that you agree to this Agreement. If you are using the Platform for an organization, you agree to this Agreement on behalf of that organization, and represent you have authority to bind that organization to the terms contained in this Agreement. If you do not or are unable to agree to this Agreement, do not use our Platform.</p>
<p>1.2 Revisions to this Agreement.  We may modify this Agreement from time to time. When we do, we will provide notice to you by publishing the most current version and revising the date at the top of this page. If we make any material change to this Agreement, we will provide additional notice to you, such as by sending you an email or displaying a prominent notice on our Platform. By continuing to use the Platform after any changes come into effect, you agree to the revised Agreement.</p>
</div>
<div id="accountmembersection">
<h4 id="your-account-and-membership">2. Your Account and Membership</h4>
<p>Summary:  You need to be at least 18 years old to use our Platform. TheTribalBox Users control the Content and membership of their TheTribalBox groups. However, we may remove any Content you post or terminate your account at any time.</p>
<p>2.1 Eligibility.  Our Platform is available to anyone who is at least 18 years old. You represent that you are at least 18. Additional eligibility requirements for a particular portion of our Platform may be set by any member who has the ability to moderate or manage that portion of our Platform. For example, the eligibility requirements for a TheTribalBox group or TheTribalBox event may be set by the Users of that group.</p>
<p>2.2 Suspension of Your Account.  We may modify, suspend or terminate your account or access to the Platform if, in our sole discretion, we determine that you have violated this Agreement, including any of the policies or guidelines that are part of this Agreement, that it is in the best interest of the TheTribalBox community, or to protect our brand or Platform. We also may remove accounts of members who are inactive for an extended period of time.</p>
<p>A member who has the ability to moderate or manage a particular portion of our Platform also has the ability, in his or her sole discretion, to modify, suspend, or terminate your access to that portion of the Platform.</p>
<p>2.3 Account Information and Security.  When you register, you provide us with some basic information, including an email address and a password. Keep your email address and other account information current and accurate. Also, you agree to maintain the security and confidentiality of your password (or else we may need to disable your account). You alone are responsible for anything that happens from your failure to maintain that security and confidentiality, such as by sharing your account credentials with others. If someone is using your password, notify us immediately.</p>
</div>
<div id="paymentsection">
<h4 id="fees-payments-and-offers">3. Fees, Payments, and Offers</h4>
<p>Summary:  We charge for certain features on our Platform. These fees are billed on a regular and recurring basis (unless you disable auto-renewal or cancel your subscription), and may change in the future.</p>
<p>3.1 Fees Charged by TheTribalBox.  Use of some of the features on our Platform is free, and we charge fees for other features. We may in the future implement a new fee, or modify an existing fee, for certain current or future features of our Platform. If we implement a new or modified fee, we will give you advanced notice such as by posting changes on our Platform or sending you an email. You agree to pay those fees and any associated taxes for your continued use of the applicable service. Unless otherwise stated, all fees and all transactions are in Indian Rupees. All fees are exclusive of applicable central, state, local, or other taxes. Subscriptions to our features are non-transferable.</p>
<p>3.2 Payments to TheTribalBox.  Users are responsible for paying subscription and any other applicable fees to TheTribalBox on time and through our approved payment methods. Users who allow their User subscription to lapse are subject to removal as the User of the TheTribalBox group or community associated with their account, and their TheTribalBox group (along with all of the information and Content associated with or posted to that TheTribalBox group) may be terminated or transferred to another member. If we terminate, suspend, or remove your account in connection with violation of this Agreement, we are not obligated to refund any User subscription fees paid to TheTribalBox. You may only pay User fees to TheTribalBox using a valid payment method acceptable to us, as specified via the Platform. You represent and warrant that you are authorized to use the payment method you designate via the Platform. You authorize us (and our designated third-party payment processors) to charge your designated payment method for the total amount of any fees you owe to TheTribalBox, including any applicable taxes and other charges. If the payment method cannot be verified, is invalid, or is otherwise not acceptable to us, your payment may be suspended or cancelled. We reserve the right to correct, or to instruct our payment processors to correct, any errors or mistakes, even if payment has already been requested or received. We also may issue refunds, or instruct our payment processors to issue refunds, in accordance with our  polices.</p>
<p>3.3 Free Trials. We may offer free trials of subscriptions and other products on our Platform. We will inform you of the length of the free trial, your renewal period, and the date and amount of your first payment. After your free trial ends, your paid subscription will begin and we will automatically bill you for each renewal period until cancellation. You can cancel automatic subscription renewals at any time according to the terms and procedures described above.</p>
<p>3.6 Third Party Payment Processors.  An User that uses the Platform to accept payments from other members, must comply with the terms and conditions of the third party provider of the applicable payment service used to receive the payment. TheTribalBox does not provide those payment services, is not a party to your agreement with the applicable third-party provider, and will not be liable or responsible for your use of those third-party payment services.</p>
<p>3.7 Third Party Transactions.  TheTribalBox group or its members may receive offers from third parties, such as discounts, sponsorships, or other benefits. TheTribalBox is not involved in any dealings or payments between you and third parties, and these Terms of Service do not govern such transactions.</p>
